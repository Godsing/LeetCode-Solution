## 题目

Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an **island** is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)

**Example 1:**

```
[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
```

Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

**Example 2:**

```
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
```

Given the above grid, return 0.

**Note:** The length of each dimension in the given `grid` does not exceed 50.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxAreaOfIsland(vector<vector<int> >& grid) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                int area = 0;
                if (dfs(i, j, &grid, &area)) {
                    result = max(result, area);  //实时更新结果
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

private:
    bool dfs(int i, int j, vector<vector<int> > *grid, int *area) {
        static const vector<pair<int, int> > directions{{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};
        if (i < 0 || i >= grid->size() || j < 0 || j >= (*grid)[0].size() || (*grid)[i][j] <= 0) 
            return false;
        (*grid)[i][j] *= -1;  //标记为-1，相当于“被访问过”的意思
        ++(*area);
        for (const auto& d: directions) {  //往4个方向继续进行深搜
            dfs(i + d.first, j + d.second, grid, area);
        }
        return true;
    }
};
