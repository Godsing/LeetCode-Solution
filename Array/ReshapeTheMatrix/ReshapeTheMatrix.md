## Problem

566. **Reshape the Matrix**

In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two **positive** integers **r** and **c** representing the **row** number and **column** number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same **row-traversing** order as they were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2,3,4]]
Explanation:
The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
Explanation:
There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.

```

**Note:**

1. The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].
2. The given r and c are all positive.

## Solution

这道题比较简单：

1. 判断是否可以reshape
2. 若可以，初始化一个待返回的新Matirx，逐个读取旧Matrix中的元素值赋到新Matrix中即可。


通过这道题可以熟悉一下二维Vector的定义与初始化。
