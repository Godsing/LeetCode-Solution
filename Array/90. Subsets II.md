## Problem

Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, **nums**, return all possible subsets (the power set).

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output:
[
  [2],
  [1],
  [1,2,2],
  [2,2],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```

 

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> subsetsWithDup(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int> > res = {{}};
        // cout << res.size() << endl;  //输出为 1，即一开始有一个空集
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ) {
            int cnt = 0;
            while (i + cnt < nums.size() && nums[i + cnt] == nums[i]) cnt++;
            int K = res.size();
            for (int k = 0; k < K; k++) {  //对于已有的 k 个子集
                vector<int> tmp = res[k];
                for (int j = 0; j < cnt; j++) {  //每个子集衍生出新的 cnt 个子集
                    tmp.push_back(nums[i]);
                    res.push_back(tmp);
                }
            }  //此时的集合个数为：k * (cnt + 1)
            i += cnt;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

Given an array (a1, a2, a3, ..., an) with each of them appearing (k1, k2, k3, ..., kn) times, the number of subset is (k1+1)(k2+1)...(kn+1).

参考了讨论版块的：[C++ solution and explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/discuss/30168/C++-solution-and-explanation) Copy 如下：

To solve this problem, it is helpful to first think how many subsets are there. If there is no duplicate element, the answer is simply 2^n, where n is the number of elements. This is because you have two choices for each element, either putting it into the subset or not. So all subsets for this no-duplicate set can be easily constructed:

num of subset

- (1 to 2^0) empty set is the first subset
- (2^0+1 to 2^1) add the first element into subset from (1)
- (2^1+1 to 2^2) add the second element into subset (1 to 2^1)
- (2^2+1 to 2^3) add the third element into subset (1 to 2^2)
- ....
- (2^(n-1)+1 to 2^n) add the nth element into subset(1 to 2^(n-1))

Then how many subsets are there if there are duplicate elements? We can treat duplicate element as a spacial element. For example, if we have duplicate elements (5, 5), instead of treating them as two elements that are duplicate, **we can treat it as one special element 5, but this element has more than two choices: you can either NOT put it into the subset, or put ONE 5 into the subset, or put TWO 5s into the subset.** 

Therefore, we are given an array (a1, a2, a3, ..., an) with each of them appearing (k1, k2, k3, ..., kn) times, the number of subset is (k1+1)(k2+1)...(kn+1). We can easily see how to write down all the subsets similar to the approach above.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int> > subsetsWithDup(vector<int> &S) {
        vector<vector<int> > totalset = {{}};
        sort(S.begin(),S.end());
        for(int i=0; i<S.size();){
            int count = 0; // num of elements are the same
            while(count + i<S.size() && S[count+i]==S[i])  count++;
            int previousN = totalset.size();
            for(int k=0; k<previousN; k++){
                vector<int> instance = totalset[k];
                for(int j=0; j<count; j++){
                    instance.push_back(S[i]);
                    totalset.push_back(instance);
                }
            }
            i += count;
        }
        return totalset;
        }
};
```
