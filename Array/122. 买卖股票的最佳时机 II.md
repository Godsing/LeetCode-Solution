## 题目

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```



## 题解

既然是可以无限操作，那么为了获得最大利润，可以波段操作：对于每一个上升波段，都记录其利润，下降的波段就不用管了。其实，因为题目只要求计算利润，所以我们只需要考虑任意两个相邻的元素，如果后一个比前一个高，就可以将其差价记录为利润的一部分。如下：

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.size() <= 1) return 0;
        int max_profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) 
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) 
                max_profit += (prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
        return max_profit;
    }
};
```

**方案二：**

但是，为了让交易次数在波段层面尽量少（题目没有要求，只是我个人考虑到人性化的操作），我复杂化了一下计算过程，过程中会判别每一个波段的最低点（稍微修改一下还可以记录每个波段的高低点价格和买卖时间），然后去更新当前上升波段的波段利润，最后汇总。程序如下：

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.size() <= 1) return 0; // if no transaction can be done, profit is 0.
        int max_profit = 0, profit_i = 0;
        bool up = false;  // a flag, "true" means the price is going up
        for (int i = 1, buyprice = prices[0]; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i] < prices[i - 1]) {
                if (up) {  // every time the price going up then down, sell the stock
                    max_profit += profit_i;
                    up = false;
                }
                buyprice = prices[i];  // buy the stock at lower price
            }
            if (prices[i] >= prices[i - 1]) {
                if (!up) up = true;  // every time the price going down then up, set flag
                profit_i = prices[i] - buyprice;  // calc profit of current transaction
            }
        }
        if (up) max_profit += profit_i;  // if price array ends with "going up", add the profit_i
        return max_profit;
    }
};
```
