## Problem

There are *n* bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the *i*-th round, you toggle every *i* bulb. For the *n*-th round, you only toggle the last bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after *n* rounds.

**Example:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 

So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.
```



## Solution

根据规则，每个灯泡都可能被 开/关 若干次，若为偶数次，则最后灯是熄灭的，若为奇数次，则最后灯是亮着的。但是如何统计每个灯泡被 开/关 的次数呢？对于第 i 个灯泡，其实就是看 i 包含的不同因子的个数。没想出比较高效的方法，于是用了笨方法——与其对每个 i 去拆解其因子，不如逆向进行：对于从 1 到 n 的每个整数，去 开/关 其整数倍位置的灯泡。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        if (n < 1) return 0;
        bool bulbs[n];
        fill_n(bulbs, n, false);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
            for (int j = i - 1; j < n; j += i)
                bulbs[j] = !bulbs[j];
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            if (bulbs[i]) res++;
        return res;
    }
};
```

这是时间复杂度 $O(n^2)$ 的解法，会超时。



## Debug&Learning

参考了讨论区的解法：<https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher/discuss/77104/Math-solution..>

```c++
int bulbSwitch(int n) {
    return sqrt(n);
}
```

A bulb ends up on iff it is switched an odd number of times.

Call them bulb 1 to bulb n. Bulb i is switched in round d if and only if d divides i. So bulb i ends up on if and only if it has an odd number of divisors.

Divisors come in pairs, like i=12 has divisors 1 and 12, 2 and 6, and 3 and 4. Except when i is a square, like 36 has divisors 1 and 36, 2 and 18, 3 and 12, 4 and 9, and double divisor 6. So bulb i ends up on if and only if i is a square.

**So just count the square numbers.**

Let R = int(sqrt(n)). That's the root of the largest square in the range [1,n]. And 1 is the smallest root. So you have the roots from 1 to R, that's R roots. Which correspond to the R squares. So int(sqrt(n)) is the answer. (C++ does the conversion to int automatically, because of the specified return type).
