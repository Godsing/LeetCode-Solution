## 题目

There are *N* gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station *i* is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station *i* to its next station (*i*+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

**Note:**

- If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
- Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
- Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

Output: -1

Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
```



## 题解

开辟一个新的数组，记为least，该数组记录从站点 i 开始旅行的话，至少需要的初始汽油量。每次从i走到j，发现走不通时，反向传播更新least数组。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        const int n = gas.size();
        vector<int> least(n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int j = i + 1, init = gas[i] - cost[i];
            for (; j%n != i; j++) {
                if (init < least[j%n]) break;
                init += (gas[j%n] - cost[j%n]);
            }
            if (j%n == i && init >= 0) return i;  //重新回到起始节点，而且剩余汽油非负
            int bp = least[j%n];
            for (int k = j-1; k >= i; k--) {
                bp -= (gas[k%n] - cost[k%n]);  //反向传播，表示到达当前节点的前一刻，至少需要盈余的汽油量
                least[k%n] = max(least[k%n], bp);
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```



## 附注

基于两个观察的O(n)时间复杂度解法：

1. 如果从站点A无法到达站点B，那么A到B之间的所有站点都不可能是可行的起点

   证明：如果A和B之间的某个站点C能到达B，而我们已知A能到达C，所以A肯定能通过C到达B，矛盾。

2. 如果总的gas量不少于总的cost量，那么至少存在一种可行解

   证明：将该行程切分成n段，使得前n-1段都是所能达到的最长旅行距离，每一段都因为缺少汽油而停止，记总缺少量为gap，则由“总的gas量不少于总的cost量”可以推出最后一段剩余的汽油量tank一定不少于gap。因此，从最后一段行程接着从头开始循环，其剩余汽油量一定足以满足所缺，从而回到最开始的起点。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int gap = 0, tank = 0, start = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.size(); i++) {
            tank += (gas[i] - cost[i]);
            if (tank < 0) {
                gap += tank;
                start = i + 1;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }
        if (tank + gap >= 0) return start;
        return -1;
    }
};
```
