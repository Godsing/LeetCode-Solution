## 题目

You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's **unique id**, his **importance value** and his **direct** subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is **not direct**.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all his subordinates.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1
Output: 11
Explanation:
Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.
```

 

**Note:**

1. One employee has at most one **direct** leader and may have several subordinates.
2. The maximum number of employees won't exceed 2000.

 

## 题解

我的思路：先用一个 unordered_map 保存 id 和其对应信息的映射，然后从第一个员工id开始，累加其 importance 值，并将其下属加入待遍历的优先队列里，逐个访问并累加其 importance 值。

```c++
/*
// Employee info
class Employee {
public:
    // It's the unique ID of each node.
    // unique id of this employee
    int id;
    // the importance value of this employee
    int importance;
    // the id of direct subordinates
    vector<int> subordinates;
};
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {
        unordered_map<int, Employee*> idmaps;
        for (auto x: employees) idmaps[(*x).id] = x;
        int imp = (*(idmaps[id])).importance;
        auto subordinates = (*(idmaps[id])).subordinates;
        priority_queue<int> subs (subordinates.begin(), subordinates.end());
        while (!subs.empty()) {
            id = subs.top();
            subs.pop();
            imp += (*(idmaps[id])).importance;
            auto subordinates = (*(idmaps[id])).subordinates;
            for (int subid : subordinates) subs.emplace(subid);
        }
        return imp;
    }
};
//Runtime: 40 ms
```

上面这种方法运行效率有点慢。其实这里对遍历下属的顺序没有要求，所以实际上并不需要用到优先队列，只需要用个 vector 来保存下属id就行了，每次访问最后一个下属id并删除（类似于栈的操作）：

```c++
/*
// Employee info
class Employee {
public:
    // It's the unique ID of each node.
    // unique id of this employee
    int id;
    // the importance value of this employee
    int importance;
    // the id of direct subordinates
    vector<int> subordinates;
};
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {
        unordered_map<int, Employee*> idmaps;
        for (auto x: employees) idmaps[(*x).id] = x;
        int imp = (*(idmaps[id])).importance;
        auto subordinates = (*(idmaps[id])).subordinates;
        vector<int> subs (subordinates.begin(), subordinates.end());
        while (!subs.empty()) {
            id = subs.back();
            subs.pop_back();
            imp += (*(idmaps[id])).importance;
            auto subordinates = (*(idmaps[id])).subordinates;
            subs.insert(subs.end(), subordinates.begin(), subordinates.end());
        }
        return imp;
    }
};
//Runtime: 32 ms, faster than 88.93% of C++ online submissions for Employee Importance.
```
