## Problem

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```



## Solution

我的思路：动态规划，用滚动数组节省空间。因为 m, n 最大可能 100，所以需要用 long long 类型来保存结果。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        long long f[n+1] = {0};
        f[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++)
                f[j] += f[j-1];
        }
        return f[n];
    }
};
```
