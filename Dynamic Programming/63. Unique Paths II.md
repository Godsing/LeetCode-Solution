## Problem

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

![img](https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/robot_maze.png)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```



## Solution

相比于【62. Unique Paths】，只需要增加一个判断即可。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& obstacleGrid) {
        if (obstacleGrid.empty()) return 0;
        int m = obstacleGrid.size(), n = obstacleGrid[0].size();
        long long f[n+1] = {0};
        f[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j-1]) f[j] = 0;
                else f[j] += f[j-1];
            }
        }
        return f[n];
    }
};
```

运行时间为 4ms，只超过 33.13 % 的 submissions. 不知道如何能更快？
