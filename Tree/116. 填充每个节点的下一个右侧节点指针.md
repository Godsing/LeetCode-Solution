## 题目

You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

 

**Example:**

```
Input: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":4},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":5},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"5","left":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":6},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"7","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"val":3},"val":1}

Output: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"right":null,"val":6},"right":null,"val":5},"right":null,"val":4},"next":{"$id":"7","left":{"$ref":"5"},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"6"},"val":3},"right":{"$ref":"4"},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"7"},"val":1}

Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B.
```

 

**Note:**

- You may only use constant extra space.
- Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.



## 题解

我的思路：

层次遍历，利用当前层已经连接好的next指针，遍历该层的同时，对下一层的节点进行next指针的连接。我发现该方法和讨论区的最高赞的方法如出一辙。

```c++
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node* next;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val, Node* _left, Node* _right, Node* _next) {
        val = _val;
        left = _left;
        right = _right;
        next = _next;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
public:
    Node* connect(Node* root) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;
        Node* node = root, *cur;
        while (node->left) {  //层次遍历的思想，利用当前层已经连接好的next指针进行层次遍历
            cur = node;
            while (cur) {
                cur->left->next = cur->right;
                if (cur->next) cur->right->next = cur->next->left;
                cur = cur->next;
            }
            node = node->left;
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```
